## papeer.com -> a research paper/researches collaboration software..

**The main idea here is that**

**The website will let students (university/collegee/shs) / ordinary researches from people like you and me.. post their researches thesis / research papers / researches on our portal**
>  professors, scientists, research experts from all over the world can make recommendations to the paper/research posted on site and they can  collaborate with it right away.

- The process of collaboration can be done in Google Docs if the student / person  accepts the collaboration request from the experts / professors they(the research experts) would immediately see the google docs link. ( Basic Stuff )
